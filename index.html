        <p><strong>Bilgisayar Mühendisi</strong> </p>

        <p>I am Sercan, after completing my education until high school in Adana,
          I went to Hatay and completed my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at Iskenderun Technical University.
          The most important thing that my education brought me was to able to produce products
          by adapting to different technologies in a short time. I developed two different Arduino projects
          in my 2 graduations thesis.<br>
          I am eagerly awaiting a role as an Software Developer in a company where I can move myself forward for my career.
          Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and review my CV. I wish to receive positive news from you soon,
          Kind Regards.
